Welcome! I'm Kornél Tóth, a Bachelor student at Eötvös Lóránd Scientific University in Faculty of Informatics. The main reason of this repo is to share some of my project and commit something to the IT community, and to give a showcase of what I'm up to at the moment. I'm still a beginner in this field, but I hope you will maybe find something useful or inspiring here.

[This repository is strongly a work in progress, actual code will come in 2020.]
